# Anti-Gravity Simulation Walkthrough

A web-based simulation of anti-gravity effects using vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. This project demonstrates physics simulations including gravity, anti-gravity zones, and object interactions.

## Features

- **Physics Engine**: Custom-built physics engine handling gravity, velocity, and collisions.
- **Interactive Objects**: Spawn and interact with floating objects.
- **Anti-Gravity Zones**: Areas where gravity is inverted or nullified.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x (for running the local server)
- A modern web browser

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Balaji07-bit/Anti-Gravity-Simulation-Walkthrough.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Anti-Gravity-Simulation-Walkthrough
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the local development server:

```bash
python start.py
```

This will automatically open the simulation in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Python** (for local server)
